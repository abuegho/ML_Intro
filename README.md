# ML_Intro

some suggestions to get you going:

1. How do you frame your main question as a machine learning problem? Is it a supervised or unsupervised problem? If it is supervised, is it a regression or a classification?
2. What are the main features (also called independent variables or predictors) that you'll use?
3. Which machine learning technique will you use?
4. How will you evaluate the success of your machine learning technique? What metric will you use?

## Submission

We'd like you to think about your machine learning approach to your project at a high level. 
* Summarize your answers to the questions above in a short (1-2 page max) document. You may use any format of your choice (R Markdown, Google Docs, Word etc).
* Add this document to the github repository for your project.
